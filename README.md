# Map-Colouring-Problem

The Map coloring problem is similar to the graph colouring problem. In map coloring the constraint is that states 
which are adjacent to each other ie share a border should not have the same color. In the case for map colouring of Austrailia 
the chromatic number is 3 meaning if number of colors used is less than 3 then we would have some states which cannot be assigned colors
as their domain size would reduce to 0. In the case of USA map colouring chromatic number is 4.

### MAP COLORING SOLUTION APPROACHES:
There are 3 approaches we have used in this project DFS, DFS with forward checking, DFS with forward checking and propagation
through singleton domain.
